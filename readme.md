# Scribble

Hey! 👋 This is my blog app called Scribble. I built it using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. Here's how to get it running.

## Quick Start 🚀

### Frontend Setup

# Go to client folder

```
cd client
```

# Install stuff

```
npm install
```

# Copy environment file

cp .env.example .env

# Start development

```
npm run dev
```

## What I Used 🛠

### Frontend

- React with TypeScript
- Apollo Client for GraphQL
- TailwindCSS for making it pretty
- React Router for pages
- React Hook Form for forms
- Zod for making sure data is valid

### Backend

- Node.js
- Express
- Apollo Server for GraphQL
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- TypeScript
- JWT for keeping users logged in

## Cool Features ✨

- Login and signup
- Create, edit, and delete posts
- Like/dislike system
- View all posts or just your own
- Works on phones too!

## Test Account 🔑

Want to try it out? Use these:

- Email: pavithran@example.com
- Password: password123

## URLs 🌐

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend: http://localhost:4000/graphql

## Notes 📝

- Make sure MongoDB is running
- Backend needs to be running for frontend to work

## Common Issues 🔧

- If the frontend can't connect, check if backend is running
- If login fails, try running the seed command first

That's it! Let me know if something's not working! 😊
